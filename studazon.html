                <h3>Project Objective</h3>
                <p class="description">To create a web application where college students can buy or sell their textbooks to other college students</p>

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p class="description">During my third year at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology, I took an elective called
                    CISC 491 Software Development Processes and Quality where I learned about agile methodologies and the software
                    methodologies used in the professional field. For the course, I <mark><b>collaborated with three other computer science students</b></mark>
                    on a <mark><b>semester-long</b></mark> project that entailed creating a website that utilized a database. Using this project, 
                    we <mark><b>applied various software development methodologies</b></mark> that we learn in class. For example, we determined the user 
                    stories and use cases for our project, and we prioritized and divided the tasks. My group decided to create a college textbook selling
                    platform because we were seniors and had the problem of having multiple unneeded textbooks.</p>

                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p class="description">Alongside another student, I was responsible for developing the <mark><b>front-end using HTML, CSS, 
                    and Java</b></mark>. I designed and developed the login, register, and forget your password pages. I also designed the 
                    modals for the create and modify listings features. Additionally, I worked with the entire group to plan iterations
                    and brainstorm features for the application.
